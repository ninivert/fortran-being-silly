# Fortran being silly while doing recursive IO

> An input/output statement that is executed while another input/output statement is being executed is a recursive input/output statement. A recursive input/output statement shall not identify an external unit that is identified by another input/output statement being executed except that a child data transfer statement may identify itsparent data transfer statement external unit.
